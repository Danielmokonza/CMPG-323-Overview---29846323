A  .gitnore file is a text file that tells github which
Files and folders to ignore before committing a project to
A repository, considering the possibility that I will have
Test files and folders saved within my project folders
And different versions of the same projects before the complete
Versions, I will use the gitnore file to ignore those files in
Favor of the complete project.

I will use a separate repository for each project start from the second
Project, I will then use a separate repository for all the POE tasks to 
be stored in, and a separate repository for all completed training.

Github has a default file location to store credentials,  the location is
$HOME/. git-credentials (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials, if the previous location doesn't exist).
